# Simple User Registration and Authentication Module

## Purpose

Project to practice Spring Boot and Spring Security.
Module will be reused for the future projects (to avoid development of these features from scratch).

Module is a work-in-progress product. Not to be used in production.

## Features

- User registration;
- User authentication;
- e-mail confirmation functionality.

## How to start

Need to configure several properties to run:

- ssl properties and database configuration in application.yml
- mail properties in mail.yml
- security properties in security.yml 

## Future enhancements

- password resent functionality.
